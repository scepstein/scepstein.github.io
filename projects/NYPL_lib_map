### Introduction

In this blog post, I plan to use the R programming language to analyze the results of the 2022 Midterm elections in New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. I will compare county and town election results from the 2020 presidential election to senatorial and gubernatorial elections in 2022. Further, I look at the impact of geospatial media markets on election results in these states. Through generation of maps and data plots, I hope to identify any connections between common media presence and trends in election results. 

### Code and Packages Used

old: content: RStudio was used as the IDE for this project. The entire project was analyzed using the R programming language. Data in csv, json, and shp file types were analyzed. The following R packages were used: rgdal, sf, rjson, ggplot2, and cowplot.
